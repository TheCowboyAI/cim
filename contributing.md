### Development Setup

#### Prerequisites

- Git with SSH commit signing configured (see `doc/commit_signing_policy.md`)
- Development environment for your chosen module language (Rust, Python, Node.js, etc.)
- NATS server for testing messaging functionality

#### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thecowboyai/cim.git

# Choose a module to work on
ls -la ~/git/thecowboyai/cim-*
```

### Coding Standards

- Follow language-specific conventions for the module you're working on
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small
