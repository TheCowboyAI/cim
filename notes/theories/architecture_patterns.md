## Content

This theory proposes that CIM's architectural patterns represent an evolution in information system design, specifically addressing the transition from paper-based to digital knowledge work.

### Core Patterns

1. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
   - Theory: EDA provides a more natural model for human information processing
   - Evidence: Matches how humans process and react to information changes
   - Application: Used in CIM for state management and updates
   - Benefits: Enables reactive and real-time processing

2. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
   - Theory: Business domains should drive system architecture
   - Evidence: Successful implementations in complex business systems
   - Application: CIM's modular domain structure
   - Challenge: Balancing domain purity with practical implementation

3. Content-Addressed Storage
   - Theory: Information should be identified by content, not location
   - Evidence: Success in distributed systems and version control
   - Application: CIM's object store implementation
   - Benefit: Natural deduplication and integrity verification

4. Composable Systems
   - Theory: Systems should be built from independent, reusable components
   - Evidence: Microservices architecture success patterns
   - Application: CIM's pod architecture
   - Challenge: Maintaining consistency across components

### Theoretical Framework

The combination of these patterns suggests a new paradigm for information systems:

1. Information as Primary
   - Move beyond document-centric thinking
   - Treat information as independent of its representation
   - Enable multiple views of the same information

2. Natural Evolution
   - Systems should grow organically
   - Architecture should adapt to usage patterns
   - Components should be replaceable

3. Knowledge Work Support
   - Focus on knowledge worker workflows
   - Enable natural information organization
   - Support multiple working styles
