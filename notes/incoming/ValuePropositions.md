# Value Propositions
Value Propositions are the way we define the bundle of Products and Services that provide Value to Customers.

We First define our Customer Segments.
These are the target customers we sell to in groups.

Each Segment will have a Customer Profile with:
  - Jobs
    - things we want to accomplish
      - Functional
      - Social
      - Emotional
  - Pains
    - things making accomplishment difficult
      - Functional
      - Social
      - Emotional
  - Gains
    - benefits we hope to gain
      - Functional
      - Social
      - Emotional

These are matched to Value Maps.

Value Map:
  - Product or Service (bundles)
  - Pain Relievers
  - Gain Providers 

These work together to provide the boundaries of each targeted Customer Segment.
