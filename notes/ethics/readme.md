# Ethics
Ethics deal with moral principles that govern a person or agent's behavior or the conducting of an activity.

We don't often consider this, but are there moral obligations and organzation or invividual may need to comply with that could alter their behavior?

These don't need to be dogmatic.

Example:
I was once asked by an employer NOT to inform customers that double paid an invoice. I refused and could have lost my job. After an ethical discussion and showing past claims about this topic that involved executives going to jail, it was decided not to proceed.

Without this ethical discussion, there is conflict between the staff as to how one should proceed when asked to do something.

Is that Company Policy, or just something you as an individual want.

If you don't declare these, you open the door to decisions you may not want to happen in the normal course of doing business.
