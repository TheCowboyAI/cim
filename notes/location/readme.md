# Locations

We have a notion of location based on a center.

This should be the center of your activity, not the center of the universe.

For us, this is the center of the Earth.

We know this means we are entering into approximation territory because the Earth, like cows, are not perfectly spherical.
This is actually fine, because on Earth, we already know what those adjustments are and can apply them as Policies.

The Location Domain is your magical way to do anything with a Location.
Convert it, Measure it, Map it, Observe it, Format it...
Whatever you want to do with a Location, it can be done here.

There is also an index of locations in use to optimize looking up locations.

# Naming Locations
Locations are stored as a vector with direction and distance.
The point of origin is declared as the center of the Earth.
This is a single point of reference.
This single point of reference is used as the pivot point for all conversions.
Latitude, Longitude and Altitude are easily converted to or derived from this point.
