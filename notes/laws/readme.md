# Laws
Governmental requirements, restrictions, or regulations we must comply with.

These are specific things that directly affect us.

We don't include every potential law, other than, we are in a geographic region and all these laws apply... Usually a reference to the federal, region and local laws at an external location.

However, if we run a restaurant, we will need to commply with Health Laws and these require known activities we must perform to remain in compliance.  We want to call these out specifically since we have regular activities based on these legal requirements.
