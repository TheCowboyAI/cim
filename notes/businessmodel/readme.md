# Business Model Canvas
How to describe your business model?

There a 9 basic concepts we use as boundaries:
  - Customer Segments
    - People and Organizations for which you are creating value.
  - Value Propositions
    - Each Customer Segment has a Value Proposition
  - Channels
    - How to we interact with customers:
      - Web
      - Phone
      - Email
      - Other specific ways to reach customers or deliver value
  - Customer Relationships
    - The Types of relationships you are establishing with customers
  - Revenue Streams
    - How, and through which pricing model is your business is capturing value
  - Key Resources
    - Assets which are indispensable to creating value
  - Key Activities
    - What do we need to be able to perform well.
  - Key Partnerships
    - Organizations or People we rely on to provide value
    - Organizations that provide Key Resources or Activitis
  - Cost Structure
    - This is the cost of each part required to provide the model

These all create defined boundaries we can **compose** in a Business Model and project a Business Model Canvas.
