# File Structure Standardization Decision

## Context

The CIM project has been evolving with diverse documentation, research notes, and implementation plans. However, the organization of this information has lacked standardization, making it difficult to track knowledge flow from research to implementation. This has led to challenges in maintaining consistency across documentation, vocabulary, and code.

## Details

After analyzing the existing project structure and knowledge management challenges, we have decided to standardize the file structure and knowledge flow process. This standardization aims to create a systematic approach to information management, ensuring that knowledge flows consistently from initial research to code implementation.

### Standardized Directory Structure

We have decided to implement the following directory structure:

```
/
├── notes/                  # Raw research and initial documentation
│   ├── incoming/           # Staging area for new documents
│   ├── claims/             # Extracted claims from documents
│   ├── research/           # Research findings and evaluations
│   ├── decisions/          # Technical and architectural decisions
│   ├── meetings/           # Meeting notes and outcomes
│   ├── reviews/            # Code and design review notes
│   └── explorations/       # Technical explorations and experiments
│
├── docs/                   # Formalized documentation
│   ├── domain/             # Domain-specific documentation
│   ├── projectBrief.md     # Core requirements and project scope
│   ├── projectContext.md   # Project existence and operation
│   ├── domainContext.md    # Current state and decisions
│   ├── systemPatterns.md   # Technical architecture
│   ├── techContext.md      # Technical environment
│   └── progress.md         # Project status
│
├── vocabulary/             # Vocabulary definitions
│   ├── domains/            # Domain-specific vocabularies
│   ├── taxonomies/         # Categorization hierarchies
│   ├── ontologies/         # Concept relationships
│   └── knowledge/          # Knowledge graph implementation
```

### Knowledge Flow Process

We have defined a standardized knowledge flow process:

1. **Document Creation**: New documents are placed in `/notes/incoming/`
2. **Document Processing**: Documents are analyzed and claims are extracted
3. **Claim Extraction**: Individual claims are stored in `/notes/claims/`
4. **Knowledge Organization**: Processed information is organized into appropriate notes subdirectories
5. **Documentation**: Key information is consolidated into formal documentation in `/docs/`
6. **Vocabulary Management**: Domain vocabulary is extracted and managed in `/vocabulary/`
7. **Code Implementation**: Implementation based on the established vocabulary

The complete flow: `/notes` → `/docs` → `/vocabulary` → `/code`

### Tooling Support

We have decided to enhance the existing vocabulary management tools to support the standardized file structure and knowledge flow:

1. **vocabulary_manager.sh**: Updated to provide a unified interface for all vocabulary management operations, with commands for claim extraction, document organization, and vocabulary analysis.

2. **CIM Ontology Tool**: Initiated the development of a specialized tool for ontology extraction, analysis, and management, integrating with Neo4j for graph database storage.

## Decisions

1. **Adopt Standardized Directory Structure**: Implement the defined directory structure with dedicated directories for incoming documents, claims, and different types of notes.

2. **Implement Knowledge Flow Process**: Follow the defined process for document creation, processing, claim extraction, knowledge organization, documentation, vocabulary management, and code implementation.

3. **Enhance Tooling Support**: Update existing tools and develop new ones to support the standardized file structure and knowledge flow process.

4. **Establish Metrics**: Define and track metrics for document processing, claim quality, knowledge organization, documentation quality, and vocabulary quality.

5. **Create Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation explaining the standardized file structure and knowledge flow process.

6. **Develop CIM Ontology Tool**: Initiate the development of a specialized tool for ontology extraction, analysis, and management.

## Next Steps

1. Create the necessary directories and update the existing file structure
2. Update the vocabulary manager script to support the new process
3. Create document templates for notes and claims
4. Implement initial metrics tracking
5. Document the standardized process in detail
6. Begin development of the CIM Ontology Tool
7. Train team members on the new process
8. Conduct initial analysis of existing documentation
