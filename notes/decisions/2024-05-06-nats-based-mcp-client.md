# Decision: NATS-Based MCP Client Implementation

## Context
The CIM Ontology Tool was designed with a NATS-based messaging architecture for the MCP (Model Context Protocol). To fully utilize this architecture, a compatible client was needed that could communicate with the server via NATS. The server code was already implemented in the cim-ontology-tool project, but a dedicated client library was required to simplify integration for various applications.

## Details
We created a standalone Rust project called `cim-client` that implements a NATS-based MCP client for the CIM Ontology Tool. The client follows Domain-Driven Design principles and provides multiple interfaces:

1. **Core Library**: A Rust library with a clean API for programmatic usage
2. **CLI**: A command-line interface for ontology management operations
3. **GUI**: A graphical user interface built with Iced for visualization and interactive editing

The client architecture includes:
- **Domain Layer**: Core entities (Ontology, Term, Relationship)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with proper propagation
- **NATS Client**: Asynchronous communication with the MCP server
- **Presentation Layers**: CLI and GUI implementations

## Decisions
1. **NATS for Communication**: Use async-nats for all client-server communication rather than HTTP to match the server's architecture
2. **DDD Architecture**: Apply Domain-Driven Design principles to maintain a clean separation of concerns
3. **Multiple Interfaces**: Provide library, CLI, and GUI interfaces to serve different use cases
4. **Async API**: Build on Tokio and async-nats for a fully asynchronous API
5. **Optional Features**: Implement CLI and GUI as optional features that can be enabled as needed

## Next Steps
1. Integrate the client with the existing CIM Ontology Tool
2. Develop automated tests for the client
3. Create documentation for API usage
4. Consider adding additional visualization capabilities to the GUI
5. Explore extending the client to support additional message patterns (e.g., streaming, long-running operations)
