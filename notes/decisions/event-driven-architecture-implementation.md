# Decision: Implementation of Event-Driven Architecture

- **Date**: 2025-03-30
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Decision Type**: Architecture
- **Domain**: CIM Ontology Tool
- **Context**: Codebase refactoring
- **Decision Makers**: Development Team

## Context

The CIM Ontology Tool was initially implemented using a traditional request-response model where operations were executed directly in response to API calls. This approach created tight coupling between components and made the codebase less flexible and harder to maintain as it grew. We needed an architecture that would allow for better separation of concerns, improved scalability, and easier extension of functionality.

## Decision

We have chosen to refactor the codebase to implement a comprehensive Event-Driven Architecture (EDA). This change converts the synchronous method calls into asynchronous events that flow through an event bus to appropriate handlers.

The key components of this implementation include:

1. **Event System**:
   - `EventBus`: A central message broker for publishing and subscribing to events
   - `EventDispatcher`: Routes events to registered handlers
   - `EventStore`: Persists events for auditing and potential replay

2. **Event Types**:
   - Clearly defined event types representing all possible domain actions
   - Structured events with metadata, payload, and context

3. **Event Handlers**:
   - `OntologyEventHandler`: Processes ontology creation, update, and deletion events
   - `QueryEventHandler`: Handles query operations like listing ontologies and searching terms
   - Custom handlers can be added for cross-cutting concerns like logging or metrics

4. **MCP Server Integration**:
   - Conversion of HTTP requests to events
   - Asynchronous response handling

## Benefits

The implementation of Event-Driven Architecture brings several advantages:

1. **Loose coupling**: Components communicate via events rather than direct method calls, reducing dependencies between modules.

2. **Improved scalability**: Event handlers can process events independently, allowing for better distribution of load.

3. **Enhanced extensibility**: New event types and handlers can be added without modifying existing code, following the Open/Closed Principle.

4. **Better testability**: Components can be tested in isolation with mock events.

5. **Resilience**: Failed operations in one handler don't affect other parts of the system.

6. **Auditability**: Events provide a natural audit trail of all operations in the system.

7. **Future-proofing**: The architecture allows for event sourcing, replay capabilities, and integration with external systems.

## Technical Implementation

We've implemented EDA through the following key technical components:

```rust
// Event structure with metadata and payload
pub struct Event {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub event_type: EventType,
    pub timestamp: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
    pub source: String,
    pub payload: serde_json::Value,
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
}

// Event bus for publishing and subscribing
pub struct EventBus {
    sender: broadcast::Sender<Event>,
}

// Handler trait for processing events
#[async_trait]
pub trait EventHandler: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn event_types(&self) -> Vec<EventType>;
    async fn handle_event(&self, event: Event) -> Result<(), EventError>;
}

// Event dispatcher that routes events to handlers
pub struct EventDispatcher {
    event_bus: EventBus,
    handlers: Arc<RwLock<Vec<Arc<dyn EventHandler>>>>,
    shutdown: Option<mpsc::Sender<()>>,
}
```

The MCP server was updated to:
1. Convert incoming requests to events
2. Publish events to the event bus
3. Process asynchronous responses

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **RPC/gRPC Approach**: Would provide structured communication but still maintain tight coupling between components.

2. **Reactive Programming**: Would provide a stream-based approach but with increased complexity and a steeper learning curve.

3. **Actor Model**: Would provide better isolation but would require a more significant architecture shift and potentially more overhead.

## Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Debugging Complexity**: 
   - *Challenge*: Asynchronous event flows can be harder to debug.
   - *Mitigation*: Added comprehensive logging and event tracing capabilities.

2. **Event Schema Evolution**:
   - *Challenge*: Changing event schemas could break handlers.
   - *Mitigation*: Using a flexible payload structure with JSON and explicit versioning.

3. **Eventual Consistency**:
   - *Challenge*: Event-driven systems are eventually consistent by nature.
   - *Mitigation*: Clear documentation on consistency guarantees and appropriate handling in the UI.

## Impact and Follow-up Actions

This architectural change affects the entire codebase but provides a solid foundation for future development. Follow-up actions include:

1. Enhance logging and monitoring for event flows
2. Add event replay capabilities for recovery scenarios
3. Implement event versioning for future schema changes
4. Add performance metrics to measure event processing times
5. Create a dashboard for visualizing event flows and system health
