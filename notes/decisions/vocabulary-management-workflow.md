# Decision: Vocabulary Management Workflow

- **Date**: 2024-12-10
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Decision Type**: Process
- **Domain**: Documentation
- **Context**: Knowledge Management
- **Decision Makers**: Documentation Team

## Context

As our project grows, maintaining consistent terminology across all components has become increasingly challenging. We've observed inconsistent use of terms, leading to confusion and misalignment between teams. A structured approach to vocabulary management is needed to ensure clarity and precision in our communication and implementation.

## Decision

We've established a formal vocabulary management workflow that will govern how terms are defined, documented, and used throughout the project:

### Vocabulary Workflow

1. **Term Identification**
   - New terms are identified during research, design, or implementation
   - Terms are captured with source context
   - Initial categorization into domain or technical category

2. **Term Definition**
   - Formal definition created with clear scope
   - Peer review of definition for accuracy and clarity
   - Examples of usage provided

3. **Integration**
   - Term added to vocabulary.md with metadata
   - Links established to relevant documentation
   - Notification to team members

4. **Usage Tracking**
   - Regular audits of term usage in codebase
   - Alignment checks between documentation and implementation
   - Identification of term drift or inconsistencies

### Storage Structure

The primary vocabulary document will be maintained in `notes/vocabulary.md` with the following format:

```markdown
## Domain Terms

### Term Name
- **Definition**: Clear, concise definition
- **Category**: Domain category (e.g., Ontology, Storage, Events)
- **Related Terms**: Links to related terms
- **Examples**: Usage examples
- **Notes**: Additional context or considerations

## Technical Terms

### Term Name
- **Definition**: Technical definition
- **Category**: Technical category (e.g., Architecture, Protocol, Pattern)
- **Usage**: How and where it should be used
- **References**: External resources or standards
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Ensuring terms are used consistently across documentation and code
2. **Clarity**: Providing precise definitions that reduce ambiguity
3. **Onboarding**: Making it easier for new team members to understand domain concepts
4. **Alignment**: Keeping documentation and implementation in sync
5. **Evolution**: Tracking how terms evolve over time

## Implementation Plan

1. Initial vocabulary document creation (Completed)
2. Integration with documentation workflow (Completed)
3. Development of audit tools (In Progress)
4. Regular vocabulary review sessions (Scheduled monthly)
5. Automated checking in CI/CD pipeline (Planned)

## Success Criteria

This workflow will be considered successful if we achieve:

1. 95% term consistency across documentation and code
2. Reduced onboarding time for new team members
3. Fewer misunderstandings in requirements and implementation
4. Ability to track vocabulary evolution over time
