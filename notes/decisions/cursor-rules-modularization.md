# Decision: Cursor Rules Modularization

- **Date**: 2025-03-30
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Decision Type**: Architecture
- **Domain**: Development Tools
- **Context**: Project Organization
- **Decision Makers**: Development Team

## Context and Problem Statement

Cursor rules are vital to our development workflow, providing AI assistant instructions that help guide code interactions and enforce project patterns and standards. However, we faced challenges with managing these rules:

1. Rules were stored as individual files in `.cursor/rules/` without clear structure
2. There was no standardized format or validation for rule content
3. Rules weren't properly version-controlled alongside code
4. The relationship between rules wasn't well-defined
5. Rule management was manual and error-prone

As our codebase and team grew, we needed a more structured approach to cursor rule management that would integrate with our existing NixOS-based infrastructure.

## Decision

We've decided to treat Cursor rules as NixOS-style modules, creating a modular system for rule definition and management. This approach creates a declarative configuration for cursor rules with the following components:

1. **Module Structure**:
   - `modules/cursor-rules/default.nix` - Core module definition with options
   - `modules/cursor-rules/config.nix` - Configuration of specific rules
   - `modules/cursor-rules/update-rules.sh` - Utility script for rule management
   - `modules/cursor-rules/README.md` - Documentation

2. **Rule Definition**:
   Each rule is defined in a structured, typed way:
   ```nix
   "rule-name" = {
     name = "rule-name";
     description = "Description of the rule";
     enabled = true;
     content = ''
       # Rule content in markdown format
     '';
   };
   ```

3. **Management Tooling**:
   We've created a utility script (`update-rules.sh`) that provides:
   - Rule status overview
   - Listing of configured rules
   - Import/export between module and `.cursor/rules/`
   - Rule synchronization

## Benefits

This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Declarative Configuration**: Rules are defined in a structured, typesafe way
2. **Version Control**: Rule definitions are tracked alongside code
3. **Reproducibility**: Rules can be consistently deployed across environments
4. **Modularity**: Rules can be composed and extended like other modules
5. **Validation**: The module definition ensures rules follow a consistent structure
6. **Documentation**: Rules are self-documenting through their structure
7. **Automation**: Rule management can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines

## Implementation

The modularization has been implemented:

1. Created the NixOS-style module for cursor rules
2. Defined the structure for rules in `default.nix`
3. Added rule definitions in `config.nix`
4. Developed the utility script for rule management
5. Updated project documentation to reflect the new structure

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple Script-Based Management**:
   - Would be easier to implement
   - Wouldn't provide the same level of structure and validation
   - Lacks integration with our NixOS-based infrastructure

2. **External Configuration Tool**:
   - Could provide a more user-friendly interface
   - Would introduce additional dependencies
   - Might not integrate well with our existing workflows

3. **Embedded Rules in Flake.nix**:
   - Would provide tight integration with our build system
   - Would make the flake configuration too complex
   - Would mix concerns (build configuration vs. development tools)
