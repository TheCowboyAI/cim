# Decision: File Structure and Workflow Standardization

**Date:** 2024-03-30
**Status:** Approved
**Decision Maker:** Project Team
**Type:** STRUCTURE, WORKFLOW

## Context

As the project has evolved, we've identified a need to standardize our file structure and knowledge management workflow. Our existing structure lacked clear pathways for processing new information and ensuring it was properly integrated into our knowledge base. This led to inconsistencies in how information was captured, processed, and made available to the project.

## Decision

We have implemented a standardized file structure and workflow to process, analyze, and integrate knowledge throughout the project. The primary changes include:

1. **Directory Structure Formalization:**
   - Created `/notes/incoming` as a staging area for new documents awaiting processing
   - Created `/notes/claims` for storing extracted claims from processed documents
   - Maintained clear separation between raw notes, formal documentation, vocabulary, and code

2. **Knowledge Flow Process:**
   - Formalized the workflow: `/notes` → `/docs` → `/vocabulary` → `/code`
   - Created scripts to analyze, validate, and report on knowledge flow between these stages
   - Implemented automated claim extraction from incoming documents

3. **Script Infrastructure:**
   - Updated `workflow_analyzer.sh` to support the current directory structure
   - Enhanced `analyze_notes_vocabulary_alignment.sh` to handle incoming documents
   - Created a comprehensive `vocabulary_manager.sh` script to manage the vocabulary workflow

## Reasoning

These changes support our project's core objectives in several ways:

1. **Improved Knowledge Traceability:**
   - Each piece of information now follows a clear path from notes to code
   - The origin of terms and concepts can be traced back to source documents

2. **Enhanced Term Consistency:**
   - Formal extraction and processing of terms ensures consistent vocabulary
   - Relationship between notes, documentation, and vocabulary is now measurable

3. **Reduced Knowledge Loss:**
   - Incoming documents are processed systematically
   - Claims are extracted and preserved even if original documents are archived

4. **Better Progress Tracking:**
   - Workflow analysis tools provide metrics on knowledge integration
   - Gaps in knowledge flow can be identified and addressed

## Implications

This decision has the following implications:

1. **Process Changes:**
   - New research and findings should be placed in `/notes/incoming`
   - Team members must run `vocabulary_manager.sh --align` to process incoming documents
   - Regular workflow analysis should be performed to identify gaps in knowledge flow

2. **Tooling Requirements:**
   - Scripts must be maintained to support this structure
   - Automation should be enhanced to further streamline the process

3. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Updated README files in each directory explain its purpose and workflow
   - Project memory documentation reflects these structural changes

## Action Items

1. Ensure all team members are aware of the new structure and workflow
2. Create training materials on how to use the vocabulary manager scripts
3. Schedule regular workflow analysis runs to track knowledge flow metrics
4. Consider additional automation for improved knowledge extraction
5. Review the effectiveness of this structure quarterly and refine as needed

## Metrics for Success

We will evaluate the success of this structural change using the following metrics:

1. **Term Alignment:** Percentage of terms appearing in both notes and vocabulary (target: >85%)
2. **Workflow Coverage:** Percentage of notes terms that flow to docs and then vocabulary (target: >75%)
3. **Documentation Completeness:** Percentage of vocabulary terms with proper definitions (target: 100%)
4. **Code Alignment:** Percentage of code terms matching vocabulary terms (target: >70%)

## Notes

This decision formalizes changes that have already been implemented. The structural updates are now supported by scripts and documentation. Future improvements may include more sophisticated claim extraction and automated term alignment.
