# Vocabulary Management Workflow Decision

## Context
The project needed a standardized approach to vocabulary management that maintains consistency from initial research through implementation. The current vocabulary system lacked a clearly defined workflow for how terms should flow from initial research notes to formal vocabulary to code implementation.

## Details
We've implemented a comprehensive vocabulary management system that follows a unidirectional flow of knowledge:

```
/notes -> /docs -> /vocabulary -> /code
```

This workflow ensures that knowledge flows consistently from initial research to final implementation, maintaining a ubiquitous language across all artifacts.

### Key Components

1. **Workflow Definition**:
   - Notes (/notes): Raw information, research findings, and initial observations
   - Documentation (/docs): Structured documentation derived from notes
   - Vocabulary (/vocabulary): Standardized terminology extracted from documentation
   - Code (/cim/src): Implementation that reflects the vocabulary

2. **Scripts and Tools**:
   - `analyze_notes_vocabulary_alignment.sh`: Analyzes how notes content aligns with vocabulary terms
   - `update_vocabulary_dashboard.sh`: Updates the vocabulary quality dashboard
   - `vocabulary_manager.sh`: Main entry point for vocabulary management tasks
   - `workflow_analyzer.sh`: Analyzes the flow from notes to code
   - `standardize_vocabulary_enhanced.sh`: Validates vocabulary against vocabulary.mdc rules

3. **Term Categories** (as defined in vocabulary.mdc):
   - Domain Objects: Entity, Aggregate, ValueObject, etc.
   - Technical Concepts: Pattern, Architecture, Protocol, etc.
   - Business Concepts: Process, Rule, Workflow, etc.
   - Cross-Cutting Terms: Security, Configuration, Monitoring, etc.

4. **Relationship Types**:
   - Hierarchical: IS_A, PART_OF, CONTAINS, EXTENDS
   - Functional: MANAGES, PROCESSES, VALIDATES, CONFIGURES
   - Temporal: PRECEDES, FOLLOWS, TRIGGERS, DEPENDS_ON

5. **Documentation**:
   - `docs/vocabulary_management_workflow.md`: Main documentation for the workflow
   - `docs/vocabulary_quality_dashboard.md`: Tracks metrics on vocabulary quality
   - `docs/notes_vocabulary_alignment.md`: Reports on alignment between notes and vocabulary

## Decisions

1. **Implement the notes -> docs -> vocabulary -> code workflow** as the standard approach for knowledge management in the project.

2. **Use the vocabulary_manager.sh script** as the primary interface for managing vocabulary, with subcommands for validation, analysis, and template generation.

3. **Track vocabulary quality metrics** through the dashboard, including term coverage, relationship types, and code reference implementation.

4. **Enforce vocabulary.mdc rules** for all terms, ensuring consistent categorization and property inclusion.

5. **Run regular alignment checks** to ensure notes content is properly reflected in vocabulary terms.

6. **Target specific metrics** for quality measurement:
   - Term Alignment (≥85%)
   - Structure Alignment (≥95%)
   - Notes → Docs Flow (≥75%)
   - Docs → Vocabulary Flow (≥80%)
   - Vocabulary → Code Flow (≥70%)
   - Category Balance (≥80%)
   - Relationship Type Balance (≥75%)
   - Code Reference Coverage (≥80%)

## Next Steps

1. Run initial analysis to establish baseline metrics
2. Integrate vocabulary workflow checking into the CI pipeline
3. Create documentation for how to add new terms following the workflow
4. Train team members on using the vocabulary management tools
5. Periodically review and update vocabulary quality dashboard
