## Content

This model describes the technical architecture of CIM, focusing on its core components and their interactions.

### Storage Model

1. Object Store ("cim-objects")
   - Purpose: Store immutable content and results
   - Characteristics:
     - Content-addressed storage
     - Immutable data blocks
     - Version tracking via graphs
     - Shape and structure metadata
   - Components:
     - Content hash identifiers
     - Program compatibility metadata
     - Block relationship graphs
     - Data shape definitions

2. Event Store ("cim-events")
   - Purpose: Track state changes and history
   - Characteristics:
     - Immutable event records
     - State change deltas
     - Temporal tracking
     - Relationship mapping
   - Components:
     - Event logs
     - State transitions
     - Delta records
     - Temporal indices

### Information Flow Model

1. Content Processing
   ```
   Input → Content Analysis → Shape Detection → 
   Content-Address Generation → Storage Assignment
   ```

2. State Management
   ```
   State Change → Event Generation → Delta Calculation → 
   Event Storage → Object Update
   ```

3. Information Access
   ```
   Request → Authorization → Content-Address Lookup → 
   Block Assembly → Delivery
   ```

### Integration Model

1. External Systems
   - Message transport systems
   - Data storage systems
   - Query systems
   - Alerting systems
   - Reporting systems

2. Internal Components
   - Content analyzers
   - Shape detectors
   - Graph managers
   - State trackers
   - Event processors

### Security Model
- Content-Address verification
- Immutable history
- Authorization controls
- System boundaries
- Integration points
