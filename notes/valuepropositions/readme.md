# Value Proposition
The Value a business promises to deliver to customers should they choose to become a paying customer, (or member for non-financial transactions).

Make a concise statement of the benefits that an organization is delivering to customers who buy its products or services. It will serve as a declaration of intent, both inside the organization and in the marketplace. 

Several Organizations may have the same Value Proposition.

This is closely related to 3 topics:
  - Pains
    - What problem does this value proposition target?
  - Gains
    - How it solves the problem, or any part of it.


A Value Proposition should be communicated to customers directly, via the company's established Communication Channels.

These channels are directly defined.

Value propositions can follow different formats, as long as they are "on brand", unique, and specific to the company in question.

A successful value proposition should be persuasive and help turn a prospect into a paying customer.
