## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
- Core event infrastructure
- NATS messaging setup
- IPLD storage implementation
- Basic domain framework
- Event correlation engine

### Phase 2: Domain Building (Months 3-4)
- Person and Organization domains
- Workflow domain with graph execution
- Document management domain
- Policy engine domain
- Cross-domain event flows

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer (Months 5-6)
- Conceptual spaces implementation
- AI agent integration (Alchemist)
- Semantic search capabilities
- Natural language interfaces
- Learning and adaptation

### Phase 4: Visualization (Months 7-8)
- Bevy 3D graph rendering
- Real-time event visualization
- Interactive workflow editing
- Domain relationship mapping
- Performance optimization

### Phase 5: Distribution (Months 9-10)
- Edge node framework
- Offline-first capabilities
- Distributed consensus
- Multi-tenant support
- Production hardening

## Success Criteria

Each phase must achieve:
- ✅ All tests passing (100% coverage for critical paths)
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met
- ✅ Security review passed
- ✅ Integration tests with other phases

## Development Principles

### Test-Driven Development
1. Write user stories
2. Create failing tests
3. Implement to pass tests
4. Refactor and optimize
5. Document thoroughly

### Incremental Delivery
- Weekly builds with new capabilities
- Continuous integration/deployment
- Feature flags for experimental features
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Quality Gates
- Code review required
- Performance benchmarks must pass
- Security scan must pass
- Documentation must be updated

## Resource Allocation

### Team Structure
- Core Architecture: 2 engineers
- Domain Development: 3 engineers
- AI/Semantic: 2 engineers
- Visualization: 2 engineers
- DevOps/Infrastructure: 1 engineer

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Rust (stable + select nightly features)
- **Messaging**: NATS with JetStream
- **Storage**: IPLD with configurable backends
- **Visualization**: Bevy Engine
- **AI**: OpenAI/Anthropic/Local models
- **Deployment**: NixOS/Docker

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance at scale**: Mitigated by distributed architecture
2. **Semantic accuracy**: Mitigated by continuous learning
3. **Graph complexity**: Mitigated by level-of-detail rendering

### Mitigation Strategies
- Proof of concepts for risky features
- Performance testing from day one
- Regular architecture reviews
- Community feedback loops

## Measurement & Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Event throughput: 10,000+ events/second
- Query latency: <10ms for hot data
- Graph rendering: 60fps for 10,000 nodes
- Semantic search: <100ms response time

### Business Metrics
- Developer productivity improvement
- Time to implement new domains
- System understanding metrics
- Error reduction rates
