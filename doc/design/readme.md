## Design Principles

### 1. Information as Living Events
- All state changes are events
- Events are immutable and append-only
- CID chains ensure cryptographic integrity
- Correlation and causation are mandatory

### 2. Domain Isolation
- Domains communicate only through events
- No shared databases or direct calls
- Each domain owns its data and behavior
- Composition without coupling

### 3. Semantic Understanding
- Conceptual spaces provide geometric meaning
- Distance equals semantic difference
- Categories form convex regions
- AI reasoning grounded in geometry

### 4. Visual Programming
- Workflows are executable graphs
- The graph is the documentation
- States as nodes, transitions as edges
- Business logic is visual

### 5. AI-Native Architecture
- Semantic foundations built-in
- Event history enables learning
- Conceptual spaces guide reasoning
- Natural language interfaces

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Event Sourcing Over CRUD**: Zero CRUD operations ensure perfect audit trails
2. **CQRS Everywhere**: Complete separation of read and write models
3. **Graph-First Workflows**: Visual representation is the execution model
4. **Geometric Semantics**: Meaning through spatial relationships
5. **Distributed by Default**: No single point of failure

## Design Process

All designs in CIM follow:
1. Start with business events, not data models
2. Define domain boundaries through event flows
3. Create visual representations before code
4. Ensure semantic understanding is possible
5. Enable AI reasoning from the start
