## Research Areas

### 1. Conceptual Spaces Theory
Based on Peter Gärdenfors' work on cognitive semantics:
- Geometric representation of concepts
- Quality dimensions and domains
- Natural categories as convex regions
- Similarity as distance

### 2. Event Sourcing & CQRS
Foundational patterns for temporal data:
- Event sourcing as temporal database
- CQRS for read/write separation
- Event correlation patterns
- Distributed event ordering

### 3. Domain-Driven Design
Eric Evans' DDD applied to distributed systems:
- Bounded contexts in distributed systems
- Event-driven domain boundaries
- Ubiquitous language enforcement
- Aggregate design patterns

### 4. Graph Theory Applications
Mathematical foundations for workflows:
- Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
- Petri nets for concurrent systems
- Graph traversal algorithms
- Visual programming theory

### 5. Distributed Systems
Principles for building resilient systems:
- CAP theorem implications
- Eventual consistency patterns
- Vector clocks and CRDTs
- Byzantine fault tolerance

### 6. Semantic Reasoning
AI foundations for understanding:
- Knowledge representation
- Ontology design
- Reasoning systems
- Embedding spaces

### 7. Category Theory
Mathematical foundations:
- Functors for system composition
- Natural transformations
- Monads for effects
- Applied category theory

## Key Insights

### Conceptual Spaces Enable AI
By representing information in geometric spaces, we enable:
- Natural similarity metrics
- Intuitive categorization
- Semantic reasoning
- Machine learning integration

### Events as Universal Truth
Event sourcing provides:
- Complete audit trails
- Time travel debugging
- Natural distribution
- Conflict-free replication

### Domains as Composition Units
DDD principles ensure:
- Clear boundaries
- Independent evolution
- Business alignment
- Reduced complexity

### Graphs as Executable Documentation
Visual workflows provide:
- Self-documenting systems
- Intuitive understanding
- Direct manipulation
- Visual debugging

## Research Applications

### 1. Information Geometry
```
Distance(A, B) = Semantic Difference
Category = Convex Region
Learning = Space Transformation
```

### 2. Event Algebra
```
Root Event: E₀ where id = correlation = causation
Caused Event: Eₙ inherits correlation, new causation
Chain: E₀ → E₁ → E₂ preserves correlation
```

### 3. Domain Composition
```
Domain A ⊕ Domain B = Composite Capability
Communication = Events Only
Coupling = Zero
```

### 4. Workflow Execution
```
Graph = Workflow Definition
Node = State
Edge = Transition
Execution = Graph Traversal
```
