# Greg Young's Research on CQRS

## Core CQRS Concepts

### 1. Command Query Separation
- **Definition**: Separate read and write operations into different models
- **Key Principles**:
  - Commands: Intent to change state
  - Queries: Intent to read state
  - No overlap between command and query models
  - Different optimization strategies for each

### 2. Command Model
- **Characteristics**:
  - Handles state changes
  - Enforces business rules
  - Validates commands
  - Generates events
- **Implementation**:
  - Domain model for validation
  - Event sourcing for persistence
  - Event publishing for propagation

### 3. Query Model
- **Characteristics**:
  - Optimized for reading
  - Denormalized for performance
  - Cached when appropriate
  - Updated asynchronously
- **Implementation**:
  - Materialized views
  - Read replicas
  - Cache layers
  - Event handlers

## Event Sourcing Integration

### 1. Event Store
- **Purpose**: Persist all state changes as events
- **Characteristics**:
  - Append-only storage
  - Event versioning
  - Optimistic concurrency
  - Event replay capability

### 2. Event Replay
- **Process**:
  - Load events from store
  - Apply to command model
  - Update query models
  - Handle event versioning
- **Optimization**:
  - Snapshots for performance
  - Parallel replay
  - Selective replay
  - Event filtering

## Scalability Patterns

### 1. Command Side
- **Scaling Strategies**:
  - Command routing
  - Command validation
  - Event generation
  - Event publishing
- **Consistency**:
  - Eventual consistency
  - Strong consistency
  - Causal consistency
  - Read-your-writes consistency

### 2. Query Side
- **Scaling Strategies**:
  - Read replicas
  - Cache layers
  - Denormalized views
  - Event handlers
- **Performance**:
  - Query optimization
  - Index management
  - Cache invalidation
  - View updates

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Event Handlers
- **Types**:
  - Synchronous handlers
  - Asynchronous handlers
  - Background workers
  - Stream processors
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Event processing
  - View updates
  - Cache management
  - Error handling

### 2. Consistency Management
- **Approaches**:
  - Eventual consistency
  - Strong consistency
  - Causal consistency
  - Read-your-writes
- **Implementation**:
  - Version vectors
  - Lamport timestamps
  - Vector clocks
  - Conflict resolution
