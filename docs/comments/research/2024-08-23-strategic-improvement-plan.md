**Concept Name:** CIM Strategic Improvement Plan
**Primary Objective:** Transition from vocabulary development to practical implementation

## Context
The CIM project has successfully established a comprehensive vocabulary structure across domains. To advance the project and create tangible outcomes, we need a structured improvement plan that transitions from theoretical foundations to practical implementation. This research document outlines our strategic improvement approach.

## Details

### Current State Assessment
- Comprehensive vocabulary structure established across domains
- Domain-specific terms with clear relationships defined
- Knowledge graph connections implemented
- WebAssembly runtime architecture defined
- NATS JetStream integration planned
- ECS backend architecture structured
- Core infrastructure components defined

### Strategic Improvement Areas

#### 1. Knowledge Graph Implementation
- **Objective**: Transform static vocabulary into actionable knowledge system
- **Approach**: 
  - Create graph schema based on vocabulary structure
  - Implement prototype in graph database
  - Connect domain vocabulary into queryable system
  - Enable cross-domain relationships
- **Success Criteria**: Functional knowledge graph with query capabilities

#### 2. Core Module Prototype
- **Objective**: Validate architectural decisions with minimal implementation
- **Approach**:
  - Develop minimal viable implementation of core modules
  - Implement event-driven communication
  - Create NixOS module for event store
  - Integrate WebAssembly runtime
- **Success Criteria**: Functional event-driven communication system

#### 3. Implementation Pattern Documentation
- **Objective**: Bridge gap between theory and practice
- **Approach**:
  - Document 3-5 key implementation patterns
  - Create pattern templates for event sourcing
  - Document content-addressed storage patterns
  - Define domain modeling patterns
- **Success Criteria**: Complete implementation guides with code examples

#### 4. Case Study Development
- **Objective**: Demonstrate practical application of architecture
- **Approach**:
  - Select focused use case (e.g., research document management)
  - Implement end-to-end example
  - Document implementation process
  - Validate architectural approach
- **Success Criteria**: Functional case study demonstrating key concepts

#### 5. AI Integration Framework
- **Objective**: Enable AI-assisted research and management
- **Approach**:
  - Create framework for AI model integration
  - Implement Ollama integration
  - Develop document processing pipeline
  - Create knowledge retrieval API
- **Success Criteria**: Functional AI assistance for research tasks

#### 6. Compliance Documentation
- **Objective**: Address governance domain requirements
- **Approach**:
  - Document compliance approach
  - Create compliance templates
  - Address data privacy requirements
  - Document security protocols
- **Success Criteria**: Complete compliance framework

#### 7. Operational Testing Framework
- **Objective**: Validate domain models in practice
- **Approach**:
  - Develop testing framework
  - Create behavior-driven tests
  - Validate domain models
  - Implement test automation
- **Success Criteria**: Comprehensive test suite for domain concepts

## Decisions
1. Transition from vocabulary implementation to implementation planning mode
2. Prioritize knowledge graph implementation as foundation for other improvements
3. Develop minimal core module prototype to validate technical approach
4. Document implementation patterns to guide future development
5. Create detailed case study to demonstrate practical application
6. Use graph database for knowledge structure implementation
7. Implement behavior-driven testing for domain concepts

## Next Steps
1. Begin knowledge graph implementation with schema design
2. Prototype core module focusing on event-driven communication
3. Document event sourcing pattern as first implementation pattern
4. Select use case for case study development
5. Research graph database options for knowledge implementation
