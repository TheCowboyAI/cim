**Concept Name:** Domain Expansion
**Primary Objective:** Expand and implement additional domain categories for the CIM system

## Context
Following the successful implementation of core domains (Models, Agents, Sources, Relationships), we need to expand to additional domain categories to provide comprehensive system coverage.

## Details

### Current State
- Core technical domains implemented
- Knowledge graph structure established
- Domain template defined
- Documentation framework in place

### Priority Domains for Implementation

1. Technical Domains
   - Environment Domain
   - Distribution Domain
   - Persistence Domain
   - Security Domain

2. Business Domains
   - Business Domain
   - Organization Domain
   - Governance Domain

3. Knowledge Domains
   - Information Domain
   - Knowledge Domain
   - AI Integration Domain

### Implementation Approach
1. Follow domain template structure
2. Maintain knowledge graph relationships
3. Document domain interactions
4. Ensure vocabulary consistency

## Research Insights

### Substrate Framework Alignment
The Substrate framework (github.com/human-substrate/Substrate) provides valuable insights into domain categorization for human understanding and progress. Key alignments with our approach:

1. Knowledge Organization
   - Arguments & Claims: Matches our knowledge validation domains
   - Data Sources: Aligns with our Sources domain
   - Models: Corresponds to our Models domain
   - Organizations: Parallels our Organization domain

2. Complementary Categories
   - Funding Sources: Could enhance our Business domain
   - Outcomes & Results: Potential extension for our Knowledge domain
   - Risks & Threats: Valuable additions to Security domain
   - Values: Aligns with our Ethics domain

3. Implementation Patterns
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Hierarchical organization
   - Cross-domain relationships
   - Evidence-based validation

### Integration Opportunities
1. Knowledge Framework
   - Adopt Substrate's argument structure for Claims validation
   - Incorporate Values framework into Ethics domain
   - Enhance risk management in Security domain

2. Domain Extensions
   - Consider adding Outcomes tracking
   - Implement Results validation
   - Include Threat modeling
   - Add Values framework

3. Relationship Mapping
   - Map Sources to Arguments
   - Link Values to Ethics
   - Connect Risks to Security
   - Integrate Outcomes with Knowledge

## Decisions
1. Implement domains in priority order
2. Follow established domain patterns
3. Maintain cross-domain relationships
4. Document domain boundaries
5. Incorporate Substrate patterns where applicable

## Next Steps
1. Create Environment domain definition
2. Establish Distribution domain structure
3. Define Persistence domain requirements
4. Document Security domain parameters
5. Review Substrate components for additional insights
