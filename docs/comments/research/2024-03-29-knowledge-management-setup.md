**Concept Name:** Knowledge Management System
**Primary Objective:** Establish foundation for CIM knowledge organization and research management

## Context
The CIM project requires a robust knowledge management system to organize research, maintain domain vocabulary, and facilitate AI integration. This research trail documents our initial setup and organization approach.

## Details

### Current State
- Project memory structure established
- Core documentation framework in place
- Domain vocabulary management initialized
- Research organization pending implementation

### Key Components
1. Knowledge Graph Management
   - Domain concept relationships
   - Research trail connections
   - Vocabulary linkages
   - Implementation references

2. Research Organization
   - Documentation structure
   - Research trails
   - Domain categorization
   - AI integration points

3. Domain Vocabulary
   - Term definitions
   - Relationship mappings
   - Usage contexts
   - Implementation references

## Decisions
1. Use project-memory.mdc for documentation structure
2. Implement research.mdc template for research organization
3. Follow vocabulary.mdc for term management
4. Maintain research trails in comments/research/

## Next Steps
1. Implement knowledge graph structure
2. Begin research collection process
3. Set up AI research assistance
4. Create initial domain mappings
