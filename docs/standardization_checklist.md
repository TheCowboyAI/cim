# Vocabulary Standardization Checklist

This document tracks the progress of standardizing all vocabulary files according to the rules in `.cursor/rules/vocabulary.mdc`.

## Progress Summary

- [x] Total files to standardize: 33
- [x] Files standardized: 33
- [x] Remaining files: 0
- [x] Completion percentage: 100%

## Standardization Approach

We're following this systematic approach:

1. **Start with simpler files**: Files that already have Cypher format but just need properties added
2. **Focus on one domain at a time**: Complete all files in a domain before moving to the next
3. **Verify after each file**: Run the standardization script on each file after updating
4. **Update this checklist**: Mark files as complete and update the progress summary

## Project Completion Summary

The vocabulary standardization project has been successfully completed with all 33 files now standardized and compliant with vocabulary.mdc rules. The project was organized in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Low complexity files (9) - All completed
2. **Phase 2**: Medium complexity files (10) - All completed
3. **Phase 3**: High complexity files (14) - All completed

All domain vocabularies now follow a consistent Cypher format with properly defined:
- Domain objects with all required properties
- Relationships between terms
- Taxonomies organizing terms
- Usage contexts describing how terms are applied
- Code references linking to implementation files

## Automation Tools

To help with standardization, we've created several scripts:

1. **scripts/standardize_vocabulary.sh**: Checks if files comply with the vocabulary rules
2. **scripts/add_term_property.sh**: Adds missing 'term' property to nodes (for low complexity files)
3. **scripts/add_missing_properties_simple.sh**: Adds all missing properties to files (for medium complexity files)
4. **scripts/convert_to_cypher.sh**: Helps convert non-Cypher formatted files to Cypher format

## How to Use the Automation Scripts

```bash
# Check if a file complies with vocabulary rules
./scripts/standardize_vocabulary.sh vocabulary/domains/file.md

# Add missing term property to nodes
./scripts/add_term_property.sh vocabulary/domains/file.md

# Add all missing properties to nodes (for medium complexity files)
./scripts/add_missing_properties_simple.sh vocabulary/domains/file.md [domain]

# Get help converting a file to Cypher format (for high complexity files)
./scripts/convert_to_cypher.sh vocabulary/domains/file.md [domain]
```

## How to Update This Checklist

After standardizing a file:
1. Mark the file as complete with [x] in both the complexity and domain sections
2. Add an entry in the Standardization Tasks Log
3. Update the Progress Summary numbers at the top
4. Commit changes to the repository
