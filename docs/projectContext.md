# CIM Project Context

## Project Existence

### Problem Space
Modern information management faces several challenges:
- Paper-centric paradigms limiting digital potential
- Scattered information across multiple systems
- Lack of secure, portable knowledge systems
- Rigid structures not adapting to domain-specific needs
- Limited AI integration in knowledge management

### Solution Approach
CIM addresses these challenges through:
1. Content-addressed, immutable information storage
2. Event-driven state management
3. Domain-specific organization
4. AI-assisted research and management
5. Secure, modular architecture

## Operation Methods

### Core Architecture
- Based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
- NixOS module system
- Content-addressed storage
- Event sourcing for state management

### Implementation Strategy
1. Bottom-up approach starting from single packages
2. Modular construction with minimal requirements
3. Reproducible builds using Nix Flakes
4. Multiple development states (dev, test, prod)
5. Security-first design principles

### User Experience Goals
1. Seamless Information Access
   - Cross-device availability
