## Notes
- Claims are unverified statements
- Assessment determines validity potential
- Verification leads to fact creation
- Arguments support claim validation

Claims are Arguments that are applied to a specific Context.

Claims must be verified by Facts.

Simple Claims:
  - john is an active User
    - john being the Argument and IsActiveUser being the Context.

Facts can be functions.

Fact Checking is quite common, but often obfuscated with some arcane meaning. We want to eliminate the obfuscation.

Not so Simple Claims:
  - climate change is affecting our customers
    - verifying climate change is really difficult, verifying local temperature increases are much easier.
    - suggest changing the claim to:
      - Pain: Increased temperature causes product failure
      - Pain Reliever: New Product has added heatsinks to improve operating tempeature range.

We want to be very specific about what we are capable of affecting. Can we solve climate change? not directly and quickly, but we can fix our product.
