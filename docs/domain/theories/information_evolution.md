## Content

This theory proposes a framework for understanding the evolution of information systems and CIM's role in this evolution.

### Historical Context

1. Paper-Centric Legacy
   - Theory: Modern computing systems were initially designed around paper output
   - Evidence: Ethernet's original purpose for printer communication
   - Impact: Business processes still reflect paper-based thinking
   - Challenge: Modern information exceeds paper's capabilities

2. Digital Transformation
   - Theory: We're in a transition period between paper and pure digital
   - Evidence:
     - Screens replacing paper for dynamic content
     - Multiple notification systems
     - Scattered information across devices
     - Knowledge workers as manual integrators

3. Information Overload
   - Theory: Current systems create overwhelming complexity
   - Evidence:
     - Multiple communication channels
     - Diverse storage locations
     - Manual context management
     - Cognitive overhead for knowledge workers

### Theoretical Framework

1. Information Evolution Stages
   - Physical (Paper) → Digital Storage → Connected Systems → Composable Knowledge
   - Each stage adds complexity without removing previous constraints
   - CIM represents transition to Composable Knowledge stage

2. Integration Patterns
   - Theory: Information naturally seeks integration
   - Current state: Human-mediated integration
   - Future state: System-mediated composition
   - CIM's role: Automated context management

3. Knowledge Work Transformation
   - From: Humans as integration points
   - To: Humans as knowledge directors
   - Via: Automated composition and context
