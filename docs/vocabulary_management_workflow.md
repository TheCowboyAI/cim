# Vocabulary Management Workflow

## Overview

This document describes the standardized workflow for vocabulary management in the CIM project, from research notes to code implementation. The workflow ensures consistent knowledge flow and alignment between documentation, vocabulary, and implementation.

## Process Steps

### 1. Document Creation and Staging
- New research documents, decisions, notes, etc. are placed in `/notes/incoming/`
- Documents follow the required format with context, details, decisions, and next steps sections
- File naming follows the convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-title.md`

### 2. Document Processing and Claim Extraction
- Documents in `/notes/incoming/` are processed using the vocabulary manager
- Claims are extracted from documents and stored in `/notes/claims/`
- Claim extraction preserves context and provenance
- Command: `./scripts/vocabulary_manager.sh extract-claims <file>`

### 3. Knowledge Organization
- Processed documents and claims are organized into appropriate `/notes/` subdirectories
- Organization is based on the document type and content:
  - `/notes/research/`: Research findings
  - `/notes/decisions/`: Technical decisions
  - `/notes/meetings/`: Meeting notes
  - `/notes/reviews/`: Code reviews
  - `/notes/explorations/`: Technical explorations
- Command: `./scripts/vocabulary_manager.sh organize <file> <target_directory>`

### 4. Documentation Creation
- Key information from notes is consolidated into formal documentation in `/docs/`
- Core documentation files are updated:
  - `projectBrief.md`: Core requirements and scope
  - `projectContext.md`: Project existence and operation
  - `domainContext.md`: Current state and decisions
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Technical architecture
  - `techContext.md`: Technical environment
  - `progress.md`: Project status
- Command: `./scripts/vocabulary_manager.sh update-docs <source_file> <target_doc>`

### 5. Vocabulary Extraction and Management
- Domain vocabulary is extracted from documentation and organized in `/vocabulary/`
- Vocabulary structure follows the defined ontologies and taxonomies
- Terms are categorized and relationships are established
- Organization follows:
  - `/vocabulary/domains/`: Domain-specific vocabularies
  - `/vocabulary/taxonomies/`: Categorization hierarchies
  - `/vocabulary/ontologies/`: Concept relationships
  - `/vocabulary/knowledge/`: Knowledge graph implementation
- Command: `./scripts/vocabulary_manager.sh extract-vocabulary <doc_file>`

### 6. Vocabulary Alignment Analysis
- Regular analysis ensures alignment between notes, documentation, and vocabulary
- Metrics track the quality and completeness of the vocabulary
- Analysis identifies gaps and inconsistencies
- Command: `./scripts/vocabulary_manager.sh analyze-alignment`

### 7. Code Implementation
- Implementation is based on the established vocabulary
- Domain-Driven Design principles are applied
- Ubiquitous language from vocabulary is used in code
- Command: `./scripts/vocabulary_manager.sh generate-model <domain>`

## Vocabulary Manager

The `vocabulary_manager.sh` script provides a unified interface for all vocabulary management operations:

```bash
# Usage
./scripts/vocabulary_manager.sh <command> [options]

# Commands
extract-claims         # Extract claims from documents
organize               # Organize documents into directories
update-docs            # Update documentation based on notes
extract-vocabulary     # Extract vocabulary from documentation
analyze-alignment      # Analyze vocabulary alignment
generate-model         # Generate code model from vocabulary
```

## Integration with CI/CD

The vocabulary management workflow is integrated with the CI/CD pipeline to ensure:
- Automated validation of new documents
- Regular vocabulary alignment checks
- Documentation updates based on commit messages
- Vocabulary quality metrics tracking

## Metrics and Analytics

The workflow includes metrics for tracking:
- Document processing volume and quality
- Claim extraction accuracy and coverage
- Vocabulary completeness and consistency
- Documentation-vocabulary alignment
- Vocabulary-code alignment

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Terminology**: Use the same terms across all documentation
2. **Regular Analysis**: Run alignment analysis regularly
3. **Atomic Commits**: Make specific, focused changes
4. **Context Preservation**: Maintain context when extracting claims
5. **Cross-Referencing**: Link related documents and concepts
6. **Versioning**: Track vocabulary changes over time
7. **Knowledge Graph**: Maintain the knowledge graph visualization

## Knowledge Flow Automation

Automation supports the workflow through:
1. Automatic claim extraction from documents
2. Vocabulary extraction from documentation
3. Alignment analysis and reporting
4. Knowledge graph updates
5. Model generation for implementation

## Workflow Evolution

The vocabulary management workflow will evolve based on:
- User feedback and usability improvements
- Integration with new tools and technologies
- Expansion to additional knowledge domains
- Enhanced automation and AI assistance

## CIM Ontology Tool Integration

The CIM Ontology Tool enhances the vocabulary management workflow by:
1. Automating ontology extraction from various file formats
2. Providing advanced comparison against seed ontologies
3. Storing and querying ontologies using Neo4j graph database
4. Enabling visualization of ontological relationships
5. Supporting version control and change tracking
6. Exposing functionality through MCP protocol endpoints

This integration enhances the vocabulary management workflow with advanced semantic analysis and graphical representation of domain knowledge.
