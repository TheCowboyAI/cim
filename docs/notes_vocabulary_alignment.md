# Notes-Vocabulary Alignment Analysis

> Report will be generated when `./scripts/analyze_notes_vocabulary_alignment.sh` is run

## Executive Summary

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Overall Alignment | TBD% | 90% | ⚠️ |
| Term Alignment | TBD% | 85% | ⚠️ |
| Structure Alignment | TBD% | 95% | ⚠️ |
| Missing Domains | TBD | 0 | ⚠️ |
| Incoming Document Processing | TBD% | 100% | ⚠️ |
| Claim Extraction | TBD% | 100% | ⚠️ |

## Detailed Metrics

This file will be automatically populated with detailed metrics when you run:

```bash
./scripts/analyze_notes_vocabulary_alignment.sh
```

The analysis will include:

1. Term coverage between vocabulary and notes
2. Domain structure alignment 
3. Missing vocabulary terms in notes
4. Potential new terms from notes
5. Processing status of documents in `/notes/incoming`
6. Extraction quality of claims in `/notes/claims`
7. Recommendations for improvement

## Enhanced Document Processing

The enhanced document processing workflow includes these steps:

1. New documents are placed in `/notes/incoming`
2. Run `./scripts/vocabulary_manager.sh --align` to process documents
3. The script analyzes documents and extracts terms and claims
4. Claims are stored in `/notes/claims` for further review
5. Processed documents can be archived (optional)

This analysis checks how well this workflow is being followed and identifies any gaps in the process.

## Purpose

This analysis helps ensure that:

1. The vocabulary accurately reflects the concepts discussed in the notes
2. Notes are properly documenting vocabulary terms
3. The domain structure is consistent across vocabulary and notes
4. New concepts in notes are being captured in the vocabulary
5. Incoming documents are being properly processed
6. Claims are being extracted and formalized effectively

## Integration with Quality Dashboard

Results from this analysis are automatically integrated into the [Vocabulary Quality Dashboard](vocabulary_quality_dashboard.md) when you run:

```bash
./scripts/update_vocabulary_dashboard.sh
```

## Directory Structure Coverage

The analysis checks how well the following directories are aligned:

- `/notes/incoming` - Documents waiting to be processed
- `/notes/claims` - Extracted claims from processed documents
- `/notes` (other) - General notes and research findings
- `/docs` - Structured documentation
- `/vocabulary/domains` - Domain-specific vocabulary
