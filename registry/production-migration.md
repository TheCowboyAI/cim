# Production Migration Tracker

## Overview

This document tracks the migration of CIM modules from development to production status. Currently, only 4 modules meet production standards. All others need to be brought up to these standards.

## Production-Ready Modules (4)

✅ **cim-domain**
- Domain patterns and traits
- Version: 1.0.0+
- Stable API since: 2024

✅ **cim-ipld**
- IPLD content-addressed storage
- Version: 1.0.0+
- Stable API since: 2024

✅ **cim-component**
- Component system for ECS architecture
- Version: 1.0.0+
- Stable API since: 2024

✅ **cim-subject**
- Subject/event algebra for message routing
- Version: 1.0.0+
- Stable API since: 2024

## Migration Process

For each module:

### Week 1-2: Assessment
- [ ] Run production readiness checklist
- [ ] Identify gaps
- [ ] Create migration plan
- [ ] Estimate effort

### Week 3-4: Implementation
- [ ] Fix critical issues
- [ ] Increase test coverage
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Security review

### Week 5: Testing
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security testing
- [ ] User acceptance

### Week 6: Release
- [ ] Version 1.0.0 release
- [ ] Update registry status
- [ ] Announce availability
- [ ] Monitor feedback

## Success Metrics

- Test coverage ≥ 80%
- Documentation completeness 100%
- Zero critical security issues
- Performance benchmarks met
- API stability confirmed

## Resources Needed

- Developer time: 2-6 weeks per module
- Security review: 1 week per module
- Testing infrastructure
- Documentation review
- Community feedback period

## Tracking

Update this document weekly with:
- Current module in migration
- Progress percentage
- Blockers identified
- Completion estimates
