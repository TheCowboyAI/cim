# Composable Information Machine (CIM)

A continuously improving, distributed system that transforms scattered information into organized, actionable, reactive knowledge while keeping it secure and accessible across your digital world.

A CIM is an encapsulation of knowledge, specialized, and partitioned by Domain. A CIM is designed to compose many Domains and efficiently create workflows and transitions between them.

By composing knowledge into Domains, we create Domain Expert Agents by simply knowing what we have, and observing the patterns of use.

We already have many well-known patterns that are typically used in the information space: People, Organizations, Inventory, Finance, Documents, Policies, and Workflows make up the bulk what we refer to as "line of business" softeware. These are the patterns and flows that make commerce possible.

A CIM is strongly-typed, meaning all the elements we creating events are already known to the system prior to actual usage. We already know our inventory, and we already know our intent.

What we don't typically know is how to assemble all the requirements and inventory together in such a way that we remove all the "unknowns" and make undesirable states unrepresentable.

This is where a Domain Based knowledge approach and an Event Driven Architecture help us make sense of this constantly changing information landscape, and the ability to decipher that information in a rapid, actionable way.
