ðŸ“Š **[View Project Dashboard](docs/dashboard.md)** - Track our progress, metrics, and next steps

CIM Goals:

- THIS SYSTEM MUST BE REPRODUCIBLE
- Represent information in the information world, in both memory and persistance layers.
- Create a system of information that is portable and can be used by any device.
- Create a system of information that is secure and can be used by any authorized user.
- Create a system that can start from nothing and build itself up over time.
- Create a system of information that is scalable and can be used by any size of business.
- Use AI Tools to make it easier to create, share, and use information. 

Out of Scope:

- Make a new Operating System.
- Make a new message transport system.
- Make a new data storage system.
- Make a new data query system.
- Make a new data alerting system.
- Make a new data reporting system.

Intent:

THIS IS A RESEARCH PROJECT DETERMINING THE NATURE OF A CIM

Use what is already available and make it better.
Contribute to Open Source projects.
Make sharing information better and more secure.
Have a permanent, immutable system of record.
Use MANY sources of truth and consolidate them by domain.
