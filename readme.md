## Project Overview

CIM Goals:

- THIS SYSTEM MUST BE REPRODUCIBLE
- Represent information in the information world, in both memory and persistence layers
- Create a system of information that is portable and can be used by any device
- Create a system of information that is secure and can be used by any authorized user
- Create a system that can start from nothing and build itself up over time
- Create a system of information that is scalable and can be used by any size of business
- Use AI Tools to make it easier to create, share, and use information

## Project Structure

The project follows a standardized file structure and knowledge flow process:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ notes/                  # Raw research and initial documentation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ incoming/           # Staging area for new documents
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ claims/             # Extracted claims from documents
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [subdirectories]    # Organized by document type
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                   # Formalized documentation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ domain/             # Domain-specific documentation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [core files]        # Key project documentation
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ vocabulary/             # Vocabulary definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ domains/            # Domain-specific vocabularies
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ taxonomies/         # Categorization hierarchies
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ontologies/         # Concept relationships
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ knowledge/          # Knowledge graph implementation
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                # Utility scripts
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/                # Implementation modules
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ cim-ontology-tool/      # Specialized tool for ontology management
```

## Knowledge Flow Process

We follow a structured knowledge flow process:

1. **Document Creation**: New documents are placed in `/notes/incoming/`
2. **Document Processing**: Documents are analyzed and claims are extracted
3. **Claim Extraction**: Individual claims are stored in `/notes/claims/`
4. **Knowledge Organization**: Processed information is organized into appropriate notes subdirectories
5. **Documentation**: Key information is consolidated into formal documentation in `/docs/`
6. **Vocabulary Management**: Domain vocabulary is extracted and managed in `/vocabulary/`
7. **Code Implementation**: Implementation based on the established vocabulary

The complete flow: `/notes` â†’ `/docs` â†’ `/vocabulary` â†’ `/code`

## Current Projects

### CIM Ontology Tool

The CIM Ontology Tool is a Rust-based MCP server for ontology extraction, analysis, and management. It integrates with Neo4j for graph database storage and can be called from Cursor and other MCP clients.

Key features:
- Extract ontological terms and relationships from various file formats
- Build and manage taxonomies from source code and documentation
- Compare extracted ontologies against seed ontologies
- Store and query ontologies using Neo4j graph database
- Expose functionalities through MCP protocol endpoints
- Analyze and visualize ontological relationships

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Project Brief](docs/projectBrief.md) to understand core requirements
2. Explore the [Domain Context](docs/domainContext.md) for current focus areas
3. Check the [Progress](docs/progress.md) for current status and next steps
4. Follow the [File Structure and Workflow](docs/file_structure_and_workflow.md) guidelines
5. See the [Vocabulary Management Workflow](docs/vocabulary_management_workflow.md) for details on the knowledge flow process

## Out of Scope

- Make a new Operating System
- Make a new message transport system
- Make a new data storage system
- Make a new data query system
- Make a new data alerting system
- Make a new data reporting system

## Intent

THIS IS A RESEARCH PROJECT DETERMINING THE NATURE OF A CIM

- Use what is already available and make it better
- Contribute to Open Source projects
- Make sharing information better and more secure
- Have a permanent, immutable system of record
- Use MANY sources of truth and consolidate them by domain
