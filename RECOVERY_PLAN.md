# CIM-Network Code Recovery Plan

## Issue
The cim-network module code was lost when the git submodule was removed. The submodule was referencing commit `531536c192da7e1bd24daaf53364cf0ee30013a3` which doesn't exist in the main repository.

## What We Know
From the previous conversation, we had:

1. **Complete working code** with 0 compilation errors
2. **191 tests passing** (186 library tests + 5 integration tests)
3. **Test coverage ~85-90%** overall, 95%+ for core business logic
4. **Complete implementation** of:
   - Domain aggregates (Network, Subnet, Router, Switch)
   - Event sourcing with event store
   - CQRS with command and query handlers
   - State machines with type-safe transitions
   - Saga pattern for complex workflows
   - NATS integration for messaging

## Recovery Options

### Option 1: Check Local Git Objects
The submodule data might still be in `.git/modules/` or in local git objects:
```bash
find .git -name "*531536c*" -o -name "*cim-network*"
git fsck --lost-found
```

### Option 2: Check System Backups
- Check if there are any system-level backups of the `/git/thecowboyai/cim/modules/cim-network` directory
- Check temporary directories for any cargo build artifacts

### Option 3: Reconstruct from Documentation
We have extensive documentation about what was implemented:
- TEST_DASHBOARD.md showed all test categories
- TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md detailed all source files
- The compilation fixes in the conversation show the exact code changes made

### Option 4: Check Build Artifacts
Look for compiled artifacts that might contain debug information:
```bash
find /git/thecowboyai -name "libcim_network*" -o -name "cim-network" -type f
find ~/.cargo -name "*cim-network*"
```

## Immediate Actions

1. **DO NOT** run `git gc` or any cleanup commands
2. **DO NOT** push any more changes until we recover the code
3. Check if the code exists in:
   - Editor temporary files
   - Shell history
   - Cargo target directories
   - System swap files

## Lesson Learned
When working with git submodules:
1. Always ensure the submodule has its own proper git repository
2. Commit and push submodule changes before removing the submodule
3. Create a backup before removing submodules
